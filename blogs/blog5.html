    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>At VehiGo, customer experience and vehicle safety are our top priorities. To ensure smoother operations and responsible usage, we've introduced new rules for handling our rental vehicles.</p>

      <p>Whether you're a frequent renter or new to the platform, these guidelines help maintain the quality of your ride and safety for all.</p>

      <h3>üîí Updated Car Handling Rules:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No Smoking Policy:</strong> All vehicles are now strictly non-smoking zones.</li>
        <li><strong>Timely Returns:</strong> Late returns beyond the grace period will incur additional charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Interior Cleanliness:</strong> Customers are responsible for keeping interiors clean; excessive mess will lead to cleaning fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Drivers:</strong> Only the registered driver can operate the vehicle.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Policy:</strong> Return the car with the same fuel level as provided during pickup.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These changes were made after analyzing feedback and service patterns. Our goal is to deliver a more consistent and trustworthy rental experience.</p>

      <p>For a complete list of rental terms and conditions, please visit our official <a href="#">Rental Policy Page</a>.</p>
