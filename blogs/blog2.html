    <h1 class="blog-title">What Cars Are Most Vulnerable?</h1>
    <div class="blog-meta">By <strong>Siddharth Menon</strong> | February 2, 2022</div>

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>In today’s connected world, cars have become more than just machines—they’re computers on wheels. But with advanced tech also comes increased vulnerability. In this post, we explore which types of vehicles are most at risk and why.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Older Models Without Security Features:</strong> Many rental cars still include models that lack GPS tracking, smart locks, or alarm systems. These are prime targets for break-ins and theft.</p>

      <p><strong>2. High-Demand Models:</strong> Cars like the Toyota Fortuner, Mahindra Thar, and premium sedans are often targeted due to their resale value and spare part demand.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Vehicles with Smart Key Systems:</strong> Ironically, cars with advanced keyless entry systems are vulnerable to "relay attacks," where thieves extend the signal from your key fob remotely.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Lack of Regular Maintenance:</strong> A vehicle that's not properly maintained is prone to both mechanical failure and safety breaches—like faulty alarms or outdated firmware.</p>

      <p>At VehiGo, we prioritize the safety of every vehicle in our fleet. From onboard diagnostics to anti-theft tracking systems, each car is equipped and monitored to reduce vulnerabilities.</p>
