    <h1 class="blog-title">Statistics Show Average Car Rental Age</h1>
    <div class="blog-meta">By <strong>Priya Deshmukh</strong> | April 15, 2022</div>

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>How old are most rental vehicles? The age of a car in a rental fleet can determine safety, comfort, and even emissions performance. Recent industry reports have revealed interesting insights.</p>

      <p><strong>According to the India Vehicle Rental Survey 2022:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ 52% of rental cars are under 3 years old</li>
        <li>✅ 30% are between 3–5 years old</li>
        <li>✅ Only 18% are above 5 years old</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This trend is influenced by fleet rotation policies, rising customer expectations, and government regulations. Modern cars are safer, more fuel-efficient, and equipped with better tech—making them preferable for rentals.</p>

      <p>At VehiGo, our average rental vehicle age is just <strong>2.4 years</strong>. We ensure our fleet remains up-to-date with the latest models, maximizing safety, comfort, and customer satisfaction.</p>

      <p>When choosing a rental service, it's wise to ask about vehicle age and condition. It can make a huge difference in your travel experience.</p>
